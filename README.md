# Coaching Tales

## Project Overview: Celebrating Female Football Coaches
This project aims to spotlight the inspiring stories of female football coaches, showcasing the significant impact they've had on the sport. By sharing their journeys, challenges, and successes, we hope to inspire the next generation, encouraging young girls to follow in their footsteps and pursue careers in football. Through this initiative, in collaboration with the National Football Museum in Manchester, we celebrate the contributions of these trailblazing women and motivate future athletes and coaches to continue breaking barriers in the sport.

## UX (User Experience)

The *Coaching Tales* website provides an engaging, app-like experience on iPads, ideal for museum visitors exploring coaching stories. The UX prioritises straightforward navigation and accessibility, guiding users smoothly through each story.

### Target Audience

### User Flow
Users can:
- Select from three coaching tales, each with a unique colour to represent its path
- Navigate content that includes text, audio, and visuals, enhancing the storytelling experience
- Finish each pathway with a summary page, reflecting their chosen journey and key insights

### Accessibility
We adhere to WCAG 2.1 standards to ensure accessibility for all users. Features like high-contrast colours, large buttons, and clear icons ensure usability for visitors with varied needs.

## UI (User Interface)

### Design Elements
The UI blends style with functionality, optimised for iPad use. Key features include:
- A circular motif symbolising a football, highlighting the coaching theme
