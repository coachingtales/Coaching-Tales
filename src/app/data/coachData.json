        "transcript": "Hello it’s Irene here. I coach boys in football through my job as a teacher at Gateforth-street School in Marylebone London. I think my mother is still quite shocked that they allow women to get jobs like teaching now. Really I am meant to be teaching the 'three Rs': reading, writing, and arithmetic. I volunteered to coach the boys in football as there was no master available to do so. I am quite pleased that there wasn’t; I am very keen on football or as they say now a 'fan'; they certainly wouldn’t have let me have a go if there had been a man free to do it! I really enjoy coaching and it's good to be able to show the boys the value of discipline and strength as well as how to do their sums.",

        "transcript": "Hello it’s Irene here. I grew up in Plymouth and I was a child during the great war. As an adult I decided to become a teacher now that women are allowed to do proper teaching. I taught at a school in Chelsea before moving here to Gateforth-street school which is part of London County Council in Marylebone. The school I was teaching at in Chelsea was very old-fashioned and I would never have been able to do this sort of thing but at this London County Council school it’s a bit more all hands to the deck if you’ll pardon the expression! Women played a lot of football during the war to raise money for wounded soldiers but once the men were back they decided that football was unsuitable for women and the FA made a new rule to stop us from playing. So I am fortunate that I get to be involved through my role as a teacher although I only coach boys. Can you imagine the fuss if girls were running around playing football?",

The trick is to be strong and steady but also ready to launch yourself in whichever direction the ball goes. Touching the ball with the tips of your fingers can be enough to send it wide. I often coach the boys in Regents Park so anyone can come and watch and they certainly do. I am not sure if it's my spectacular coaching they come to see or just the spectacle of a woman teaching the boys football. I don’t play much football myself these days but I am a keen observer and I have managed to give the boys a few handy tips. I also give them the motivation to practice and foster a bit of team spirit.",

The other masters, despite being mostly cricketers and rowers who think football rather brutish, are also perfectly happy to give me pointers on my coaching. During the throw-in, your feet should not cross the line and you should hold the ball with both hands behind your head. If you spread your fingers apart you will maintain a better grip and you should face the direction that you want to throw the ball.",

When the men were away fighting in that dreadful war it was left to us to do these jobs or they would not have been done at all. I think that’s one of the reasons we are getting more opportunities now. And why shouldn’t we be allowed to do these sorts of jobs, what with Miss Pankhurst and her 'Suffragettes' getting some of us the vote now?",

Some of my friends play hockey but they tend to do it amongst themselves and not for an audience as some people still frown upon women running around; they consider the sport too aggressive for a lady’s temperament. I do have a friend that participated in a walking contest for the Women’s League of Health and Beauty that drew quite a crowd. The women who walked the most gracefully and daintily won a sash. I think I’ll stick to coaching! And I’ll let you in on a little secret: last summer I coached the boys' cricket team and am very proud to say that they won the district championship! I hope our football team can do the same!",

Lately after many months of trying we managed to get the use of a field at Manor Farm so we can finally play matches at home as well as away. Up until now we have been having training sessions in our garden!",

I liked to dress up in miniskirts but it made my mother roll her eyes and my father said I was asking for trouble wearing a thing like that. I thought they were such bores. I am married now and my husband is a business executive. We live in a nice area in Cheshire. I get busy organising events for the local community, some of which go well and some of which don’t. There was such a fuss about one barbecue I organised because the bar didn’t turn up; it even made the local paper. The headline read: A barbecue with no beer!",

We’ll soon have some goalposts up there and be able to use it for matches and training. We still don’t have permanent premises for the Ashton Heyes Youth Club either. Here we are practicing the header. There wasn’t anything about this in the rulebook; it just tells you the rules rather than how to play, so I got some advice from my husband. I tell the boys they should keep their eyes on the ball, use their forehead for control and accuracy, generate power from the upper body, and get their timing and positioning right. They are getting pretty good at heading the ball between them.",

It says the length of the field should be between 100-130 yards and the width between 50-100 yards. This came in handy when we were discussing how much land we would need to use for a pitch with the farmer at Manor Farm. The offside rule states that a player is offside if, at the moment the ball is played to them, they are nearer to their opponent’s goal line than both the ball and the second-last opponent unless they are in their own half or behind the ball.",

I also run a local youth football league in our area. I think more people should take the time to volunteer their time with community groups. It helps the kids, keeps them out of trouble and gives them some structure and discipline. I enjoy doing it myself; it’s a great way to stay involved in the local community.",

I don’t mind doing it; it’s a great way to keep the kids active and it gives them a lot of skills for the future. There’s been some talk about starting a girls football team, but that’s still in the early stages. Maybe one day I’ll coach them too!",
