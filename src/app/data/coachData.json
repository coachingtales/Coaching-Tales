				"transcript": "Hello it’s Irene here. I coach boys in football through my job as a teacher at Gateforth-street School in Marylebone London. I think my mother is still quite shocked that they allow women to get jobs like teaching now. Really I am meant to be teaching the “three Rs”: reading, writing, and arithmetic. I volunteered to coach the boys in football as there was no master available to do so. I am quite pleased that there wasn’t; I am very keen on football or as they say now a “fan”; they certainly wouldn’t have let me have a go if there had been a man free to do it! I really enjoy coaching and it's good to be able to show the boys the value of discipline and strength as well as how to do their sums.",

				"transcript": "Hello it’s Irene here. I grew up in Plymouth and I was a child during the great war. As an adult I decided to become a teacher now that women are allowed to do proper teaching. I taught at a school in Chelsea before moving here to Gateforth-street school which is part of London County Council in Marylebone. The school I was teaching at in Chelsea was very old-fashioned and I would never have been able to do this sort of thing but at this London County Council school it’s a bit more all hands to the deck if you’ll pardon the expression! Women played a lot of football during the war to raise money for wounded soldiers but once the men were back they decided that football was unsuitable for women and the FA made a new rule to stop us from playing. So I am fortunate that I get to be involved through my role as a teacher although I only coach boys. Can you imagine the fuss if girls were running around playing football?",

Touching the ball with the tips of your fingers can be enough to send it wide. I often coach the boys in Regents Park so anyone can come and watch and they certainly do. I am not sure if it's my spectacular coaching they come to see or just the spectacle of a woman teaching the boys football. I don’t play much football myself these days but I am a keen observer and I have managed to give the boys a few handy tips. I also give them the motivation to practice and foster a bit of team spirit.",

The other masters, despite being mostly cricketers and rowers who think football rather brutish, are also perfectly happy to give me pointers on my coaching. During the throw-in, your feet should not cross the line and you should hold the ball with both hands behind your head. If you spread your fingers apart you will maintain a better grip and you should face the direction that you want to throw the ball.",

I think that’s one of the reasons we are getting more opportunities now.

I do have a friend that participated in a walking contest for the Women’s League of Health and Beauty that drew quite a crowd. The women who walked the most gracefully and daintily won a sash. I think I’ll stick to coaching! And I’ll let you in on a little secret: last summer I coached the boys' cricket team and am very proud to say that they won the district championship! I hope our football team can do the same!",

Here we are practicing the header. There wasn’t anything about this in the rulebook; it just tells you the rules rather than how to play, so I got some advice from my husband. I tell the boys they should keep their eyes on the ball, use their forehead for control and accuracy, generate power from the upper body, and get their timing and positioning right. They are getting pretty good at heading the ball between them.",

It says the length of the field should be between 100-130 yards and the width between 50-100 yards. This came in handy when we were discussing how much land we would need to use for a pitch with the farmer at Manor Farm. The offside rule states that a player is offside if, at the moment the ball is played, any fewer than three opponents, including the goalkeeper, are between the player and the goalkeeper. It also says that the ball should weigh somewhere between 14-16 ounces but I don’t bother weighing them. I think they’re probably alright.",

So I knew I couldn't stay in Sheffield, didn't really want to go home, dunno why. Just didn't really want to go back to the Northeast as yet. So anyway, job came up in Leeds and I thought I, I'll apply. And I got this job in Leeds and it was in a middle school in the heart of Leeds.\n\n… till the girls wanted, well we were obviously having football in lessons and then they said, can we have a, a practise? You know, can we have a foot footy team? Because that you have to split boys and girls at 11 under the EFA, um, English Football Schools Association. You can't have mixed teams after under 11.\n\nI organised a, a little game against another one of the local schools and I said, you know, we're just starting off. And it was somebody I played netball with and what their PE teacher, I played netball with her in, we started a team there. And uh, I said, do you wanna bring some of yours down? Well, we'll just, you know, we'll take it as it comes.\n\nYes, it was a Saturday morning. Saturday morning. 'cause that's when you did your PE at the time, you know, your, all your matches tended to be played at weekends still then. So it was a Saturday morning and I thought, oh God, goodness knows how many of mine will turn up. 'cause you know, it was, as I say, it was an interesting area of Leeds, quite flaky, <laugh>, whether they turned up at the school, nevermind a match <laugh>. Um, but they all arrived. They all arrived. Giddy as giddy can be. Um, it was gorgeous. It was good 'cause we'd borrowed the, the kit, you know, so we were in Kit, so that was giddy enough. And, um, yeah, we played the won, we played the match and we won. Um, and that just inspired them to want to play more and more.",

Very young I was out on my bike on my, my scooter with friend, my friend Rosie. We went everywhere together, um, which was quite a funny mix really 'cause Rosie was a musician. She was very arty, very musical. She would go in to have her cello lessons while I went to go and have a netball match or a, you know, um, have a game of something or other, or climb another tree. So we were quite chalk and cheese, but we got on so well.\n\nAnd again, played all the, the usual sports. So got into the local athletics team.\n\nUsed to train regularly there. At school played for the, as you would back in those days, the netball and the hockey teams. Um, loved playing tennis later. Not in my early childhood, 'cause my comprehensive school didn't have net uh, tennis courts. So you didn't play <laugh>, you know, you played the sports that were there. Um, mum and dad always just let me go and do whatever I wanted. Really, you know, encouraged me to play, didn't really know much about sport themselves, but didn't limit me to do anything. Um, so yes, just constantly outside playing something or other. Um, so no lovely, lovely memories of my childhood, really supportive family.\n\nWhere I grew up, we went to a comprehensive school and then we didn't have a sixth form at that time. There was a sixth form college. So all of the, the local secondaries, you all went to a sixth form college, which actually was a brilliant, a brilliant transition from school to uni, really.

Um, and again, it was a Saturday. It was your own time. It wasn't through. And if I've got a feeling it was only a day, it was only a day's course, which which was brilliant, you know, went along. There might have been a couple of, of us, um, different teacher, female teachers, um, some male teachers. So again, it was a mix mixture of it. And it just went through, not too different to what I was doing, which was really reassuring, you know, I thought, whew, I'm not off the beaten track yet, you know, I'm, I'm actually doing things like that or seem to be right. And it just helped to put that into perspective and, and learn a few more of the technical and tactical bits.\n\nI’d been obviously doing football at school and by this time change school. So I'd moved to um, a school in Guiseley, so outta the centre of Leeds out in the outer area of Leeds to school in Guiseley.  \n\n85 I started there I think, yeah, because these will be 86 when I got the prelim.\n\nSo I took all of the stuff turned up where it set on the first day and looked around, I said, and there's a few people there and then walked around the corner. There was a lot of people there. I said, is this, is this where the football is? And he went, yeah, this is it. Alright. Right, right. And so the guy running it, he went, so you must be Michelle. Then I went, I am. He said, well, I'm saying this Michelle, but I thought it was Michael <laugh>. I said, no, I'm Michelle <laugh>.\n\nUh, he went, right, right. And then he went to the other guy who was running the course and they came back a bit sheepish and laughing. They went, we've only got one toilet and one changing room. <laugh>, I went okay. Fortunately I'm changed then aren’t I. So I'm all right. Um, but, and we, we went over for the full week. Well, was it, I think it might have been a four day course, you know, part of, of that first week. And it was brilliant. You know, it was darned hard work 'cause you did have all the coaching and then you, you know, you were practical and you were have to be, um, being trained yourself as to how to do it. And then you would be given it a, um, a particular subject that you have to coach the next day, you know, and show how you would build it up and coach it.\n\nSo, um, that was the homework bit that Cath was on about. 'cause you would go back, read through your notes and figure out what practises you were gonna do and what the main emphasis of that, you know, if it's gonna be the long pass. You needed to know how we the technical side of what part of the foot to kick it with and what the follow through is and blah blah. So, um, it was good. It was, it was darned hard work.\n\nSo went down and had this, this meeting that more or less maintained that, you know, we are wanting to develop the women and, um, girls and women's football. We do need somebody to lead this. You do, you know, we think you've got the calibre to do it and to do it, you're gonna really need to, to have the provenance.\n\nSo you're gonna need your full badge.\n\nIt was at, um, <inaudible>, which somewhere down Telford way I think in Shropshire, Telford. I got my AZ out and found out. Cause you didn’t have sat navs.\n\nIt's beautiful big old house and all the sports complexes and fields galore and everything. Gorgeous.\n\nI read out what my final assessment 'cause you, you build up from a small like, um, a small practise to a small sided game. And the final one was like a full 11 sided game tactical thing. So mine was them V 11 distribution from the goalkeeper. So that was how the goalkeeper distributes the ball and to get it forward.\n\nSo yeah that was my last one.\n\nSo you, you did all of that. And then on the final day you went to the theory. So you went into a proper lecture theatre. You all sat down, you got your exam papers, you had to answer like a proper exam theory of it. And then once you'd finished it, 'cause people were finishing at different times, um, you could go. So you didn't really have an opportunity of all just saying bye either. 'cause people were dashing off and this, that, and t’other, so it was, it was a funny end to the course really.",

So this was my, after my first year I wrote this, but, it was numbers of participating. So what I did in the different regions, um, what junior leagues, the Youth Games, Coaching Association. So I literally went through and put down what happened and I put things like initially much of my time was spent making good contacts and establishing areas to target first. I had to, I had to know who were gonna be responsive, um, and who you thought that's not gonna happen here just yet. You know. \n\nUm, and I got in touch with all of the, the other football development officers in, in and around Greater Manchester. Obviously all male, but I got in contact with them and then a few of them Partington, that's a place, isn't it? Down around there. There was a few who had female managers and were into really developing girls and females sport. That was really good.\n\nThis is what I mean, you didn't have any graphics, you know, you didn't, this is my <laugh> you know, practise of a number of participating women and girls. So this was your 4,000. So in that year I got 40 people through prelim. Uh, I got 90 teachers through the teaching award. I got leaders 'cause there was something called the Leaders Award as well, which was sort of like the youth group and things. So I got, you know, 40 people through that teachers taster sessions too. So I've had 200 teachers on teachers taster sessions, workshops, how many workshops? Teacher inset days. I've done schools coaching, 4,000 kids I've coached.\n\nWeekly coaching so you know, you've got 1,160 kids coming on a week holiday, five a side tournaments, children's tasters. So that was me trying to show the FA particularly numbers that I have had an impact in this time it might not be as great, but there's one of me, <laugh> one of me. And until I get these doing their job, it'll keep limited. So that was where my main essence was. So, yeah. Um, so yes, it, it was setting up and getting established with a lot of, um, the different like sports centres who then I could base myself if they were receptive and they were willing to do, you know, coaching sessions at that point. I would then look at the schools and say to the, the, um, you know, the manager or whoever was working within which schools, you know, which teachers come regularly with the kids, who's in the sport, which, which schools are going to target first. So I just tapped into all of this and then I got in touch with like, um, PE advisors of your different local authorities and contacted them and said, you know who and what so, yeah.",
